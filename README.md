## Codes and notes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### This repository stores web programming codes for future reference if necessary.

The objective of this repository is to develop my knowledge and, mainly, to fix it. It also shares my notes on web languages and practices Git and GitHub tools, as well as all code documentation, from comments to READMEs with Markdown.

The HTML codes have been completed, and the CSS codes started. After completing the CSS styling language course, the JavaScript codes will be developed.

In the HTML folder, finalized HTML codes are stored. They do not have any elaborate structure or developed pages; they are only code examples and notes taken during the classes that can serve as a reference if necessary.

The codes and notes recorded here were developed using various sources, but the online courses on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPEpaft1y1k&t=1593s">HTML</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1J6gY40yMo">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McKNP3g6VBA">JavaScript</a> on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programacaoweb">Programação Web</a> channel on YouTube were one of the main sources.
